# YouTube Analytics Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS using trending YouTube video data from Kaggle. The final result is a business-ready QuickSight dashboard to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where a video streaming analytics team wants to:
- Understand what type of content performs well across regions (US, GB, CA)
- Track daily video performance trends
- Identify top performing creators and categories
- Measure user engagement through views, likes, and comments

The dataset used is from Kaggle's [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new).

---

## ✅ Project Goals
- **Data Ingestion**: Automatically ingest CSV and JSON files into AWS S3 (raw layer)
- **ETL System**: Clean and transform raw data using AWS Glue (PySpark)
- **Data Lake Formation**: Store data in partitioned Parquet format (cleansed layer)
- **Scalability**: Use serverless services like Glue, Lambda, and S3 for handling scale
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Entirely built and deployed on AWS
- **Reporting**: Deliver insights through an interactive Amazon QuickSight dashboard
